You are in a totally dark room. The only light in the room comes from an old LED digital alarm clock (with four seven segment displays). The clock display is HH:MM (no seconds). The clock is configured to display time in 24 hour format and the leading digit is blank if not used. What is the period of time between when the room is at its darkest, to when it is at its lightest?
