# The Devil's chessboard
The Devil invites Alice and Bob to a special game. 

He starts by explaining the game to both of them. He will give them time to plan their strategy and only then he will start the game.
The game will work as follows:

1.  Alice enters the room with the devils through the main door. 
2.  The devil presents an empty 8x8 chessboard in front of Alice.
3. The devils randomly places coins either with "Heads" [black] side up, or with "Tails" [white] side up.
4. The Devils will look deeply into Alice's eyes and point to his favorite coin among the 64 coins placed on the chessboard. 
5. Alice can take how much time she wants, but eventually she needs to flip exactly one coin upside down from the board. No less than 1, no more than 1. 
6. After this, she must leave the room through the back door without contacting Bob. 

7. Upon her leave, the devil will invite Bob. Bob will look at the current board, seeing it for the first time.
8. Bob can think for how long as he will like, but eventually he'll have to point at the devil's favorite coin, as he told Alice before. 
9. He gets only one guess. So he cannot afford to be wrong.



Can you help Alice and Bob defeat the Devil in his own game?
