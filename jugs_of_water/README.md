# Measure exact amount of water
Given 3 jugs of water, 
Jug 1 can hold up to 10 [unit] of water, but currently has 0 in it. 
Jug 2 can hold up to  5 [unit] of water, but currently has 5 in it. 
Jug 3 can hold up to  6 [unit] of water, but currently has 6 in it. 
Can you fill jug 1 with exactly 8[unit]? 

Rules: 
You can move water from any jug to any jug.
In each transfer you try to move all of the water, but you stop when the jug is full. 

Example: 
moving from a jug of size 10 with 8 [units] in it, to a jug of size 6 which is empty, will result in a jug with 2[u] in it, and a jug with 6[u] in it. 


Can you solve the riddle for N jugs? each with its own capacity?
