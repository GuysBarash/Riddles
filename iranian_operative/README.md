# Secrets, spies and numbers
An iranian agent has kidnapped a syrian agent! he has dragged him into a cellar and attempts to extract where key intel is stored. 
The iranian knows that the intel is stored in a locker room in a specific bulding, but he doesn't know which locker. 

You are an israeli agent, you are an expert in bomb-making, black belt in jiu jitsu and you can tell with a look if someone is lying.
The iranian agent, on the other hand, does not know when someone is lying. 

you see the interrogation through a small window in the cellar. From the window you can only *hear* the iranian agent, and you can only *see* the syrian agent. 

Iranian: we already know the locker number is between 13 and 1,300. 
Syrian: [No answer] 

Iranian: Is the locker number smaller than 500? 
Syrian: [You can't hear the answer, but you see that he LIE]

Iranian: Is the locker number a perfect square? 
Syrian: [LIE] 

Iranian: Is the locker number a perfect cube? 
Syrian: [Tells the TRUTH] 

Iranian: Now, if you can tell me if the second digit is "1", i will have the locker number.

The syrian agent is about to answer, but the iranian agent stands up and blocks your sight! an answer was given but you couldn't see or hear!
The iranian agent leaves the room and calls his boss, "We have the number, i'm leaving now".

You know that the Iranian has the wrong number because the Syrian lied twice. But can you tell what the right number is?
